          1. The Julian Calendar

    For many European institutions, we can thank the Romans (for good or
    for bad, though they too had their predecessors in the Greeks,
    Egyptians and Babylonians). So with the solar calendar currently in
    widespread use.

    Originally the Romans numbered years ab urbe condita, that is, "from
    the founding of the city" (of Rome, where much of the character of
    the modern world had its beginnings). Had this old calendar remained
    in use, 1996-01-14 would have been New Year's Day in the year 2749
    a.u.c. (In this article dates are often given in IS0 8601 format
    <formats.htm>.)

    Following his conquest of Egypt in 48 B.C. Julius Caesar consulted
    the Alexandrian astronomer Sosigenes about calendar reform (since
    the a.u.c. calendar then used by the Romans was completely
    inadequate to the needs of the emerging empire, which Caesar was
    poised to command, briefly as it turned out). The calendar which
    Julius Caesar adopted in the year 709 a.u.c. (what we now call
    46 B.C.) was identical to the Alexandrian Aristarchus' calendar of
    239 B.C., and consisted of a solar year of twelve months and of 365
    days with an extra day every fourth year. It is unclear as to where
    or how Aristarchus arrived at this calendar, but one may speculate
    that Babylonian science was involved.

    As we can read in the excellent article, "The Western Calendar and
    Calendar Reforms" in the Encyclopedia Brittanica, Sosigenes decided
    that the year known in modern times as 46 B.C. should have two
    intercalations. The first was the customary intercalation of 23 days
    following February 23, the second, "to bring the calendar in step
    with the equinoxes, was achieved by inserting two additional months
    between the end of November and the beginning of December. This
    insertion amounted to an addition of 67 days, making a year of no
    less than 445 days and causing the beginning of March, 45 B.C. in
    the Roman republican calendar, to fall on what is still called
    January 1 of the Julian Calendar."

    According to a contributor <tobin.html> to the CALNDR-L
    <http://www.personal.ecu.edu/MCCARTYR/calndr-l.html> mailing list,
    Julius Caesar wanted to start the year on the Spring Equinox or the
    Winter Solstice, but the Senate, which traditionally took office on
    January 1st, the start of the Roman civil calendar year, wanted to
    keep January 1st as the start of the year, and Caesar yielded in a
    political compromise.

    The Roman date-keepers initially misunderstood Caesar's instructions
    concerning the new calendar (according to Macrobius), and
    erroneously held every third year, rather than every fourth year, to
    be a leap year. There is some dispute as to exactly which years from
    43 B.C. through to 8 A.D. were actually leap years, but a
    reconstruction which is consistent with the available evidence is
    that every third year following 43 B.C. (i.e. 40 B.C., 37 B.C.,
    etc.) was a leap year, until 10 B.C., after which, according to this
    hypothesis, Augustus Caesar (Julius Caesar's successor) suspended
    leap years, reinstating them with the leap year of 4 A.D.

    Another source of uncertainty regarding exact dating of days at this
    time derives from changes made by Augustus to the lengths of the
    months. According to some accounts, originally the month of February
    had 29 days and in leap years 30 days (unlike 28 and 29 now). It
    lost a day because at some point the fifth and six months of the old
    Roman calendar were renamed as Julius and Augustus respectively, in
    honor of their eponyms, and the number of days in August, previously
    30, now became 31 (the same as the number of days in July), so that
    Augustus Caesar would not be regarded as inferior to Julius Caesar.
    The extra day needed for August was taken from the end of February.
    However there is still no certainty regarding these matters, so all
    dates prior to A.D. 4, when the Julian Calendar finally stabilized,
    are uncertain.

    Subsequently the Julian Calendar became widespread as a result of
    its use throughout the Roman Empire and later by various Christian
    churches, which inherited many of the institutions of the Roman world.

    The system of numbering years A.D. (for "Anno Domini") was
    instituted in about the year 527 A.D. by the Roman abbot Dionysius
    Exiguus <http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05010b.htm>, who reckoned
    that the Incarnation had occurred on March 25 in the year 754
    a.u.c., with the birth of Jesus occurring nine months later. Thus
    the year 754 a.u.c. was designated by him as the year 1 A.D. It is
    generally thought that his estimate of the time of this event was
    off by a few years (and there is even uncertainty as to whether he
    identified 1 A.D. with 754 a.u.c. or 753 a.u.c.).

    The question has been raised (by Sean Oberle) as to whether the
    first Christian millennium should be counted from 1 A.D. or from the
    year preceding it. According to Dionysius the Incarnation occurred
    on March 25th of the year preceding 1 A.D. (with the birth of Jesus
    occurring nine months later on December 25th), so it is reasonable
    to regard that year, rather than 1 A.D. as the first year of the
    Christian Era. In that case 1 A.D. is the second year, and 999 A.D.
    is the 1000th year, of the first Christian millennium, implying that
    1999 A.D. is the final year of the second Christian millennium and
    2000 A.D. the first year of the third.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

          2. The Gregorian Reform

    The average length of a year in the Julian Calendar is 365.25 days
    (one additional day being added every four years). This is
    significantly different from the "real" length of the solar year.
    However, there is uncertainty among astronomers as to what the
    length of the solar year really is (see Simon Cassidy's Error in
    Statement of Tropical Year <cassidy/err_trop.htm>). The main
    competing values seem to be the "mean tropical year" of 365.2422
    days ("mean solar days") and the "vernal equinox year" of 365.2424
    days. The difference of the length of the Julian calendar year from
    the length of the real solar year is thus 0.0078 days (11.23
    minutes) in the former case and 0.0076 days (10.94 minutes) in the
    latter case.

    <http://www.personal.ecu.edu/MCCARTYR/inter-grav.html> Whatever,
    this error accumulates so that after about 131 years the calendar is
    out of sync with the equinoxes and solstices by one day. Thus as the
    centuries passed the Julian Calendar became increasingly inaccurate
    with respect to the seasons. This was especially troubling to the
    Roman Catholic Church because it affected the determination of the
    date of Easter, which, by the 16th Century, was well on the way to
    slipping into Summer.

    Pope Paul III recruited several astronomers, principally the Jesuit
    Christopher Clavius (1537-1612), to come up with a solution. They
    built upon calendar reform proposals by the astronomer and physician
    Luigi Lilio (d. 1576). When Pope Gregory XIII was elected he found
    various proposals for calendar reform before him, and decided in
    favor of that of Clavius. On 1582-02-24 he issued a papal bull,
    Inter Gravissimas,
    <http://www.personal.ecu.edu/MCCARTYR/inter-grav.html> establishing
    what is now called the Gregorian Calendar reform. (The full text may
    be read in both the Latin original and a French translation
    <http://hermes.ulaval.ca/~sitrau/calgreg/bulle.html> by Rudolphe
    Audette, and in an English translation
    <http://www.bluewaterarts.com/calendar/InterGravissimas.htm>,
    recently done by Bill Spencer.)

    The Gregorian reform consisted of the following:

        * Ten days were omitted from the calendar, and it was decreed
          that the day following (Thursday) October 4, 1582 (which is
          October 5, 1582, in the old calendar) would thenceforth be
          known as (Friday) October 15, 1582.

        * The rule for leap years was changed. In the Julian Calendar a
          year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4. In the Gregorian
          Calendar a year is a leap year if either (i) it is divisible
          by 4 but not by 100 or (ii) it is divisible by 400. In other
          words, a year which is divisible by 4 is a leap year unless it
          is divisible by 100 but not by 400 (in which case it is not a
          leap year). Thus the years 1600 and 2000 are leap years, but
          1700, 1800, 1900 and 2100 are not.

        * New rules for the determination of the date of Easter were
          adopted.

        * The position of the extra day in a leap year was moved from
          the day before February 25th to the day following February 28th. 

    According to some, the term "leap year" derives from the fact that
    the day of the week on which certain festivals were held normally
    advanced by one day (since 365 = 7*52 + 1), but in years with an
    extra day the festivals would "leap" to the weekday following that.
    However, it may be derived from an old Norwegian word "hlaupâr"
    which entered the English language at the time of the Viking
    invasions (8th - 10th Centuries).

    In his excellent book Marking Time Duncan Steel remarks (p.165) that
    it is often claimed that part of the Gregorian reform consisted in
    setting the first day of the year (New Year's Day) to January 1st,
    but that in fact the papal bull made no reference to the date of New
    Year's Day. January 1st was already New Year's Day in many European
    countries. The ecclesiastical New Year coincided with Christmas Day
    until it was changed to January 1st by Pope Pius X in 1910 (coming
    into effect in 1911).

    It may be noted that there was no necessity for ten days, rather
    than, say, twelve days to have been omitted from the calendar. In
    fact, the calendar could have been reformed without omitting any
    days at all, since only the new rule for leap years is required to
    keep the calendar synchronized with the vernal equinoxes. The number
    of days omitted determines the date for the Spring equinox, an
    omission of ten days resulting in a date usually of March 20th.

    The vernal equinox year during the last 2000 years is 365.2424 days.
    The average length of the Julian year (365.25 days) differs from
    this value by 0.0076 days. So from the year 1 to the year 1582 the
    calendar drifted off the vernal equinox year by 1581*0.0076 = 12.02
    days. Why didn't Pope Gregory remove twelve days, instead of just
    ten? It has to do with the First Council of Nicea, which was held in
    Nicea (now Iznik, Turkey) in the year 325 CE. One of the matters
    settled by this council was the method for determining the date of
    Easter (which should occur around the vernal equinox), so as to make
    it independent of the Jewish Calendar. From the year 325 to the year
    1582 the calendar diverged (from the vernal equinox) by 1257*0.0076
    = 9.55 days, so ten days were removed in an attempt to restore the
    date of the vernal equinox to (about) the same date of the year at
    which it had occurred at the time of the Council of Nicea.

    The matter is not this simple, however, because the date of the
    vernal equinox in the calendar of the Roman Catholic Church as
    established by the Council of Nicea (in 325 A.D.) is March 21, but
    the effect of removing ten days in 1582 had the result that the
    vernal equinox occurs in the Gregorian Calendar mostly on March 20,
    less often on March 21, sometimes on March 19 and sometimes even on
    March 22 according to local time in the Far East. So should Pope
    Gregory have omitted nine days? Or perhaps eleven? Presumably Pope
    Gregory's astronomical advisors considered all three possibilities.
    Some say that the choice of ten was a compromise, supported by the
    fact that the omission of ten days made it easier to correct old
    calendars simply by the insertion of an "X" (the Latin numeral for
    "10").

    In fact a non-Gregorian calendar reform (involving a 33-year cycle
    <cassidy/33yr-cal.htm> and a prime meridian running through Virginia
    <dst01.htm>) would have stabilized the vernal equinox at March 21
    for the whole world, but this possibility (assuming it was
    considered by the Pope) was rejected, presumably on political grounds.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

          3. Adoption of the Gregorian Calendar

    The Gregorian Calendar was adopted immediately upon the promulgation
    of Pope Gregory's decree in the Catholic countries of Italy, Spain,
    Portugal and Poland, and shortly thereafter in France and
    Luxembourg. During the next year or two most Catholic regions of
    Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands came on board.
    Hungary followed in 1587. The rest of the Netherlands, Denmark,
    Germany and Switzerland made the change during 1699 to 1701. By the
    time the British were ready to go along with the rest of Europe, the
    old calendar had drifted off by one more day, requiring a correction
    of eleven days, rather than ten. The Gregorian Calendar was adopted
    in Britain (and in the British colonies) in 1752, with (Wednesday)
    September 2, 1752, being followed immediately by (Thursday)
    September 14, 1752.

    In many countries the Julian Calendar was used by the general
    population long after the official introduction of the Gregorian
    Calendar. Thus events were recorded in the 16th to 18th Centuries
    with various dates, depending on which calendar was used. Dates
    recorded in the Julian Calendar were marked "O.S." for "Old Style",
    and those in the Gregorian Calendar were marked "N.S." for "New Style".

    To complicate matters further New Year's Day, the first day of the
    new year, was celebrated in different countries, and sometimes by
    different groups of people within the same country, on either
    January 1, March 1, March 25 or December 25. January 1 seems to have
    been the usual date but there was no standard observed. With the
    introduction of the Gregorian Calendar in Britain and the colonies
    New Year's Day was generally observed on January 1. Previously in
    the colonies it was common for March 24 of one year to be followed
    by March 25 of the next year. This explains why, with the
    calendrical reform and the shift of New Year's Day from March 25
    back to January 1, the year of George Washington's birth changed
    from 1731 to 1732. In the Julian Calendar his birthdate is
    1731-02-11 but in the Gregorian Calendar it is 1732-02-22.

    Sweden adopted the Gregorian Calendar in 1753, Japan in 1873, Egypt
    in 1875, Eastern Europe during 1912 to 1919 and Turkey in 1927.
    Following the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia it was decreed that
    thirteen days would be omitted from the calendar, the day following
    January 31, 1918, O.S. becoming February 14, 1918, N.S. (Further
    information can be found in The Perpetual Calendar
    <http://www.norbyhus.dk/calendar.html> and here
    <http://www.tondering.dk/claus/cal/node3.html#SECTION00324000000000000000>.)

    In 1923 the Eastern Orthodox Churches adopted a modified form of the
    Gregorian Calendar in an attempt to render the calendar more
    accurate (see below). October 1, 1923, in the Julian Calendar became
    October 14, 1923, in the Eastern Orthodox calendar. The date of
    Easter is determined by reference to modern lunar astronomy (in
    contrast to the more approximate lunar model of the Gregorian system).

    The Gregorian Calendar is the calendar which is currently in use in
    all Western and Westernized countries, and Dionysius Exiguus's
    system of numbering years A.D. has endured to the present time.

    The abbreviation A.D. is short for "Anni Domini Nostri Jesu
    Christi", i.e., "in the year of Our Lord Jesus Christ". Since
    Muslims, Jews, etc., may not be entirely comfortable with this, the
    designation "A.D." is now sometimes replaced by the more neutral
    C.E. (for "Christian Era"), and instead of B.C. ("Before Christ")
    B.C.E. (for "Before Christian Era") is sometimes used.

    CE is also an abbreviation of "Common Era". The Common Era Calendar
    is the same as the Gregorian Calendar except that instead of
    numbering years BC/AD the astronomical system of year numbering is
    used (this system is explained in the next section). In this article
    (and elsewhere on this website) dates designated "CE" are almost
    always dates in this Common Era Calendar. Note that "BCE" is not
    used with dates in the Common Era Calendar. The date 2 BCE, meaning
    the year 2 "before Christian Era", a.k.a. 2 BC, is the same as the
    year -1 CE.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

          4. Astronomical Year Numbering

    Astronomers designate years prior to 1 A.D. by means of zero and
    negative numbers, according to the sequence of numbers ..., -2, -1,
    0, 1, 2, .... Between the year 1 and the year -1 there occurs the
    year 0. Thus astronomers adopt the following convention:

    1 A.D. = 1 C.E. =  year 1
    1 B.C. = 1 B.C.E. = year 0
    2 B.C. = 2 B.C.E. = year -1 and so on

    More generally, a year popularly designated n B.C. or n B.C.E. is
    designated by astronomers as the year -(n-1).

    The rules for leap years work for years prior to 1 C.E. only if
    those years are expressed according to the astronomical system, not
    if expressed as years B.C.E.  4 C.E. is a leap year in both
    calendars, 1 B.C.E. = astronomical year 0, 5 B.C.E. = year -4,
    9 B.C.E. = year -8, and so on, are all leap years. 101 B.C.E. =
    year -100 is a leap year in the (proleptic <#Proleptic>) Julian
    Calendar but not in the (proleptic) Gregorian Calendar. These
    statements, however, are only theoretically true, because (as noted
    above) prior to 4 C.E. the leap years were not observed correctly by
    the Roman calendrical authorities.

    As noted above, the Common Era Calendar is the same as the Gregorian
    Calendar except that instead of numbering years BC/AD the
    astronomical system of year numbering is used.

    The choice of which system of numbering years to use is relevant to
    the question: When Does the New Millennium Begin? <newmill.htm> as
    can be seen from the following:

Gregorian   Religiously   Common Era
Calendar     Neutral       Calendar
3 BC         3 BCE          -2 CE
2 BC         2 BCE          -1 CE
                      CE millennium begins 0-01-01 CE
1 BC         1 BCE           0 CE
Gregorian millennium usually taken to begin 1-1-1 AD
1 AD         1 CE            1 CE
2 AD         2 CE            2 CE
...          ...            ...
1998 AD      1998 CE        1998 CE
1999 AD      1999 CE        1999 CE
                      CE millennium ends   1999-12-31 CE
                      CE millennium begins 2000-01-01 CE
2000 AD      2000 CE        2000 CE
Gregorian millennium usually taken to end   2000-12-31 AD                        
Gregorian millennium usually taken to begin 2001-1-1 AD
2001 AD      2001 CE        2001 CE

    January 1st, 1 AD is usually taken to be the start of the first
    Christian millennium, but a case could be made for January 1st, 1 BC
    (see the comment above concerning the incarnation <#Dionysius>),
    which would imply that the third Christian millennium began on
    January 1st, 2000 AD.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

          5. The Proleptic Julian and Gregorian Calendars

    Every date recorded in history prior to October 15, 1582
    (Gregorian), such as the coronation of Charlemagne as Holy Roman
    Emperor on Christmas day in the year 800, is a date in the Julian
    Calendar, since on those dates the Gregorian Calendar had not yet
    been invented.

    We can, however, identify particular days prior to October 15, 1582
    (Gregorian), by means of dates in the Gregorian Calendar simply by
    projecting the Gregorian dating system back beyond the time of its
    implementation. A calendar obtained by extension earlier in time
    than its invention or implementation is called the "proleptic"
    version of the calendar, and thus we obtain the proleptic Gregorian
    Calendar. The Julian Calendar also can be extended backward as the
    proleptic Julian Calendar.

    For example, even though the Gregorian Calendar was implemented on
    October 15, 1582 (Gregorian) we can still say that the date of the
    day one year before was October 15, 1581 (Gregorian), even though
    people alive on that day would have said that the date was October
    5, 1581 (the Julian date at that time).

    Similarly, dates after October 15, 1582 (Gregorian) have equivalent,
    but different, dates in the Julian Calendar. For example, the first
    version of this article was completed on 1992-10-10 in the Gregorian
    Calendar, but it is also true to say that it was completed on
    1992-09-28 in the Julian Calendar. As another example, the date of
    the winter solstice in the year 2012 is 2012-12-21 (Gregorian),
    which is 2012-12-08 (Julian).

    Thus any day in the history of the Earth, either in the past or in
    the future, can be specified as a date in either of these two
    calendrical systems. The dates will generally be different; in fact
    they will be the same only for dates from March 1st, 200, to
    February 28, 300. The dates in neither calendar will coincide with
    the seasons in the distant past or distant future, but that does not
    affect the validity of these calendars as systems for uniquely
    identifying particular days.

    (See also a note I sent to the CALNDR-L mailing list Re: Proleptic
    calendar conventions <prolept.htm>.)

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

          6. Variation in the Tropical Year

    The tropical year (a.k.a. the mean solar year) corresponds to the
    cycle of the seasons. The exact definition of this concept is
    currently a matter of debate among some astronomers (see Simon
    Cassidy's Error in Statement of Tropical Year
    <cassidy/err_trop.htm>). All agree, however, that due to the
    gravitational dynamics of the Sun-Earth-Moon system the length of
    the tropical year (however defined) is changing slowly. The length
    of the tropical year on 2000-01-01 is calculated by some astronomers
    to be 365.24218967 days, but at this level of precision the value
    depends on the definition of the concept. The value changes
    significantly with the millennia, however, as follows (according to
    a formula in common use among astronomers):

  Year           Length of tropical year in days
 -5000           365.24253
 -4000           365.24250
 -3000           365.24246
 -2000           365.24242
 -1000           365.24237
     0           365.24231
  1000           365.24225
  2000           365.24219
  3000           365.24213
  4000           365.24207
  5000           365.24201

    Thus the value of the tropical year varies over this 10,000-year
    timespan by as much as .00052 days (about 45 seconds).

          7. Accuracy of the Gregorian and Orthodox Calendars

    As in any completely rule-based calendar, the Gregorian Calendar is
    not absolutely accurate. In the Gregorian Calendar the average
    length of a year is 365.2425 days (since there are 146,097 days in
    400 calendar years). This is a lot closer to the "real" length of
    the solar year than is the case with the Julian Calendar. As noted
    above <#Gregorian_Reform>, the main competing values for the length
    of the solar year are 365.2422 days (the mean tropical year) and
    365.2424 days (the vernal equinox year). The difference of the
    length of the Gregorian calendar year from the length of the real
    solar year is thus 0.0003 days (25.9 seconds) in the former case and
    0.0001 days (8.6 seconds) in the latter case. Were the length of the
    "mean solar year" to be constant this error would accumulate to one
    day after about 3,336 years (if we use the 365.2422 value) or after
    about 10,000 years (if we use the 365.2424 value).

    Whereas in the Gregorian Calendar a century year is a leap year only
    if division of the century number by 4 leaves a remainder of 0, in
    the Eastern Orthodox system a century year is a leap year only if
    division of the century number by 9 leaves a remainder of 2 or 6.
    This implies an average calendar year length in the Orthodox
    Calendar of 365.24222 days. This is very close to the present mean
    solar value of 365.24219, and the Eastern Orthodox Calendar is at
    present significantly more accurate in this respect than the
    Gregorian. Were the mean solar year to remain constant, the Orthodox
    Calendar would be off by one day only after about 33,000 years.
    However over the next few millennia the Orthodox calendar, like the
    Gregorian, will become increasingly inaccurate with respect to the
    mean solar year until possibly recovering around 10,000 years from
    now. However, in terms of the vernal equinox year the Gregorian
    Calendar is more accurate than the Orthodox and will remain more
    accurate in the coming millennia.

          8. True Length of the Tropical Year

    The tropical year <cassidy/tropanom.htm> has been defined as "the
    time it takes the Sun to appear to travel around the sky from a
    given point of the tropical zodiac back to that same point in the
    tropical zodiac." As Simon Cassidy has pointed out (Error in
    Statement of Tropical Year <cassidy/err_trop.htm>) this value
    depends on where in the Earth's orbit one begins the measurement of
    one revolution about the Sun. If the point used is the point of the
    vernal equinox then the value is 365.2424 tropical days (so this is
    the value of the "vernal-equinox year"). If one wishes an average
    value that is the mean of the values obtained by using different
    orbital starting points, then a value of 365.24219 days emerges.
