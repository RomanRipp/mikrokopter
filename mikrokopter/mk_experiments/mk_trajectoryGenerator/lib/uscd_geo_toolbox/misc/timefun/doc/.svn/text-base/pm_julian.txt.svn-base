          1. Introduction

    Just as a Gregorian date is a date in the Gregorian Calendar, a
    Julian date is a date in the Julian Calendar. (For more on these
    calendars see The Julian and Gregorian Calendars <cal_art.html>).
    Astronomers sometimes use the term "Julian date" in another sense,
    according to which it is related to what is called a "Julian day
    number". Such a use of the term "Julian date" makes it ambiguous,
    but the meaning is usually clear from the context. In this article
    the notion of the Julian day number will be explained, along with
    various meanings of the term Julian date.

    According to the system of numbering days called Julian day numbers,
    used by astronomers and calendricists (those who study calendars,
    unfortunately not for a living), the temporal sequence of days is
    mapped onto the sequence of integers, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. This
    makes it easy to determine the number of days between two dates
    (just subtract one Julian day number from the other).

    For example, a solar eclipse was seen at Nineveh on June 15, 763
    B.C. (Julian Calendar), according to the Assyrian chronicles in the
    British Museum, and a lunar eclipse occurred there on the night of
    April 14-15, 425 B.C. (Julian Calendar). (The Lunar Calendars and
    Eclipse Finder <../lcef/lcef.htm> program tells us that these
    eclipses occurred at approximately 10:32 a.m. and 2:27
    a.m. respectively.) The Julian day numbers corresponding to these
    dates are 1,442,902 and 1,566,296 respectively. This makes it easy
    to calculate that the lunar eclipse occurred 123,394 days after the
    solar eclipse.

    Generally speaking, an integer date is any system of assigning a
    one-to-one correspondence between the usual sequence of days (and
    nights) and the integers. Such systems differ only in the day chosen
    to correspond to day 0 or day 1. For example, in some applications
    NASA uses the Truncated Julian Date, which is the number of days
    since 1968-05-24 (at which time the Apollo missions to the Moon were
    underway). Other starting dates popular with computer programmers
    are, or have been, 1601-01-01 GC (Gregorian Calendar), 1900-01-01,
    1901-01-01 and 1980-01-01 (when time began according to IBM PCs).
    The choice is usually a consequence of a trade-off concerning
    (i) the temporal precision required (days to microseconds), (ii) the
    length of the period of interest (a decade, a century, a millennium,
    etc.), (iii) the number of bytes available for storing the date and
    (iv) the number of characters required to display the date.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

          2. The Julian Period

    The Julian day number system is sometimes (erroneously) said to have
    been invented by Joseph Justus Scaliger (born 1540-08-05 JC in Agen,
    France, died 1609-01-21 JC in Leiden, Holland), who during his life
    immersed himself in Greek, Latin, Persian and Jewish literature, and
    who was one of the founders of the science of chronology. Scaliger's
    invention was not the system of Julian day numbers, but rather the
    so-called Julian period.

    Scaliger combined three traditionally recognized temporal cycles of
    28, 19 and 15 years to obtain a great cycle, the Scaliger cycle, or
    Julian period, of 7980 years (7980 is the least common multiple of
    28, 19 and 15). According to the Encyclopedia Brittanica:

        "The length of 7,980 years was chosen as the product of 28 times
        19 times 15; these, respectively, are the numbers of years in
        the so-called solar cycle of the Julian calendar in which dates
        recur on the same days of the week; the lunar or Metonic cycle,
        after which the phases of the Moon recur on a particular day in
        the solar year, or year of the seasons; and the cycle of
        indiction, originally a schedule of periodic taxes or government
        requisitions in ancient Rome."

    According to some accounts Scaliger named his Julian period after
    his father, Julius Scaliger. However in his De Emandatione Temporum
    (Geneva, 1629) Scaliger says: "Julianam vocauimus, quia ad annum
    Julianum accommodata ..." (translated by R. L. Reese et al. (3)
    <#refs> as "We have termed it Julian because it fits the Julian year
    ...").

    Regarding the Julian period the U.S. Naval Observatory has this to say:

        "In the 16th century Joseph Justus Scaliger tried to resolve the
        patchwork of historical eras by placing everything on a single
        system. Not being ready to deal with negative year counts, he
        sought an initial epoch in advance of any historical record. His
        approach was numerological and utilized three calendrical
        cycles: the 28-year solar cycle, the 19-year cycle of Golden
        Numbers, and the 15-year indiction cycle. The solar cycle is the
        period after which week days and calendar dates repeat in the
        Julian calendar. The cycle of Golden Numbers is the period after
        which moon phases repeat (approximately) on the same calendar
        dates. The indiction cycle was a Roman tax cycle of unknown
        origin. Therefore, Scaliger could characterize a year by the
        combination of numbers (S,G,I), where S runs from 1 through 28,
        G from 1 through 19, and I from 1 through 15. Scaliger first
        stated that a given combination would recur after 7980 (= 28 x
        19 x 15) years. He called this a Julian cycle because it was
        based on the Julian calendar. Scaliger knew that the year of
        Christ's birth (as determined by Dionysius Exiguus) was
        characterized by the number 9 of the solar cycle, by Golden
        Number 1, and by number 3 of the indiction cycle, or (9,1,3).
        Then Scaliger chose as this initial epoch the year characterized
        by (1,1,1) and determined that (9,1,3) was year 4713 of his
        chronological era [and thus that year (1,1,1) was 4713 B.C].
        Scaliger's initial epoch was later to be adopted as the initial
        epoch for the Julian day numbers." ? The 21st Century and the
        3rd Millennium <http://aa.usno.navy.mil/AA/faq/docs/millennium.html>

    It turns out, however, that the Julian period was discovered by
    others before Scaliger. Roger, Bishop of Hereford, discusses the
    three cycles used by Scaliger in his Compotus (written in 1176 CE)
    and states that "these three ... do not come together at one point
    for 7980 years" (see (5) <#refs>), although he does not identify the
    year (4713 B.C.) of their coincidence. Furthermore, according to R.
    L. Reese et al. (6) <#refs>:

        "A 12th-century manuscript indicates that the 7980-year period
        was used explicitly for calendrical purposes by an earlier
        Bishop of Hereford, Robert de Losinga, in the year A.D. 1086,
        almost a century before the Bishop of Hereford named Roger. ...
        Robert de Losinga combines the solar, lunar and indiction cycles
        into a "great cycle [magnum ciclum]" of 7980 years ... Thus the
        manuscript by Robert de Losinga places the earliest known use of
        the Julian period in the year A.D. 1086."

    The first Julian period began with Year 1 on -4712-01-01 JC (Julian
    Calendar) and will end after 7980 years on 3267-12-31 JC, which is
    3268-01-22 GC (Gregorian Calendar). 3268-01-01 JC is the first day
    of Year 1 of the next Julian period.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

          3. Julian Day Number

    Although Joseph Justus Scaliger was, as noted above, one of the
    founders of the science of chronology, he did not invent the Julian
    day number system. Its inventor was the astronomer John W. F.
    Herschel. Lance Latham writes:

        "It remained, however, for the astronomer John F. Herschel to
        turn this idea [of Scaliger's] into a complete time system,
        rather than a method of relating years. In 1849, Herschel
        published Outlines of Astronomy and explained the idea of
        extending Scaliger's concept to days." ? The Standard C
        Date/Time Library, p.42. 

    Following Herschel's lead astronomers adopted this system and took
    noon GMT -4712-01-01 JC (January 1st, 4713 B.C.) as their zero
    point. (Note that 4713 B.C. is the year -4712 according to the
    astronomical year numbering <cal_art.html#Astronomical>.) For
    astronomers a "day" begins at noon (GMT) and runs until the next
    noon (so that the nighttime falls conveniently within one "day",
    unless they are making their observations in a place such as
    Australia). Thus they defined the Julian day number of a day as the
    number of days elapsed since noon GMT on January 1st, 4713 B.C., in
    the Proleptic Julian Calendar <cal_art.html#Proleptic>.

    Thus the Julian day number of -4712-01-01 is 0. The Julian day
    number of 1996-03-31 CE (Common Era) is 2,450,174 ? meaning that on
    1996-03-31 CE 2,450,174 days had elapsed since -4712-01-01 JC.

    Actually "day" here means a day and a night. Calendricists have a
    word for a day and a night, namely, "nychthemeron". Generally when
    calendricists use the term "days" they are talking of nychthemerons.

    In most calendars the calendar date changes at midnight. In these
    calendars a nychthemeron is the period from one midnight to the
    next. For astronomers, however, a nychthemeron runs, not from
    midnight to midnight, but from noon to noon. And in some calendars,
    e.g., the Jewish Calendar, a nychthemeron runs from sunset to
    sunset. Thus a nychthemeron simply means a day and a night, and
    cannot be more precisely defined except with respect to some
    particular calendar or class of calendars.

    The Julian day number is a count of nychthemerons elapsed since some
    particular nychthemeron. Thus there are slight variations on the
    Julian day number system depending on which kind of nychthemeron is
    being counted, as we shall see below.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

          4. Astronomical Julian Day Number and Astronomical Julian Date

    An astronomical Julian day number is a count of astronomical
    nychthemerons (i.e., nychthemerons which begin at noon GMT) from the
    astronomical nychthemeron which began at noon GMT on -4712-01-01 JC.

    For recording the time of an astronomical event the Julian day
    number of the nychthemeron in which the event occurs is, of course,
    usually not sufficiently precise. In order to specify the time of an
    event astronomers add a fractional component to the Julian day
    number, e.g., 0.25 = six hours (1/4 of 24 hours) after the start of
    the nychthemeron. An astronomical Julian day number plus a
    fractional component specifying the time elapsed since the start of
    the nychthemeron denoted by that Julian day number is called an
    astronomical Julian date. (The term "Julian date" has several
    meanings, as explained in Section 8 <#different_meanings> below.)

    Thus the astronomical Julian date 0.5 is the midnight point
    separating -4712-01-01 JC and -4712-01-02 JC, the astronomical
    Julian date 1.25 is 6 p.m. on -4712-01-02 JC, and so on.

    An astronomical Julian day number can also be seen as an
    astronomical Julian date which is an integer, and which denotes the
    period running from the start of an astronomical nychthemeron (noon
    GMT) to the start of the next.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

          5. Chronological Julian Day Number and Chronological Julian Date

    At some point students of calendrical science decided that the
    Julian day number system would be very useful in their field,
    provided the notion of a "day", i.e., "nychthemeron", were changed
    to accord with that notion as commonly used in connection with
    calendars. The Gregorian Calendar begins days at midnight, but not
    all calendars do (for example, the Jewish Calendar has nychthemerons
    which begin at sunset). Thus arose a variation of the Julian day
    number and Julian date called "chronological" to distinguish them
    from the "astronomical" versions.

    A chronological Julian day number is a count of nychthemerons,
    assumed to begin at midnight GMT, from the nychthemeron which began
    at midnight GMT on -4712-01-01 JC. Chronological Julian day number 0
    is thus the period from midnight GMT on -4712-01-01 JC to the next
    midnight GMT. Chronological Julian day number 2,452,952 is the
    period from midnight GMT on 2003-11-08 CE (Common Era) to the next
    midnight GMT.

    Again a fractional component may be added to the chronological
    Julian day number to form a chronological Julian date. For example,
    the chronological Julian date 0.5 is noon GMT on -4712-01-01 JC, the
    chronological Julian date 1.25 is 6 a.m. GMT on -4712-01-02 JC, and
    the chronological Julian date 2,452,952.75 is 6 p.m. GMT on
    2003-11-08 CE.

    So defined, a chronological Julian date is tied to zero degrees
    longitude because the fractional component denotes time elapsed
    since midnight GMT. We may, however, wish to use the concept in
    connection with calendars intended to be used at other places on
    Earth, where midnight is midnight local time and not midnight GMT.
    For example, nychthemerons denoted by dates in the Chinese Calendar
    run from midnight Beijing standard time to the next midnight BST,
    and midnight in Beijing occurs eight hours earlier than midnight at
    Greenwich.

    So in order to use the concept of a chronological Julian date when
    studying calendars whose dates denote nychthemerons which begin at
    midnight local time, but not midnight GMT, we can define a local
    chronological Julian date whose value is the GMT-based chronological
    Julian date with a value between 0 and 0.5 added or subtracted to
    account for the timezone difference (added for locations East of
    Greenwich, subtracted for locations West of Greenwich). For example,
    chronological Julian date 2,452,952.75 with respect to Beijing,
    which denotes 6 p.m. on the Beijing-nychthemeron numbered 2,452,952,
    equals the chronological Julian date 2,452,952.75 - 1/3 =
    2,452,952.417 with respect to Greenwich (which is 10 a.m. on
    2003-11-08 CE).

    Thus, although there is only one variety of astronomical Julian date
    (the one tied to the meridian of zero degrees longitude) there are
    as many varieties of chronological Julian date as there are
    longitudes we might wish to use in the study of various calendars.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

          6. Modified Julian Day Number

    Since most days within about 150 years of the present have Julian
    day numbers beginning with "24", Julian day numbers within this
    300-odd-year period can be abbreviated. In 1957 the convention of
    the modified Julian day number was adopted by the Smithsonian
    Astrophysical Observatory:

    Given a Julian day number JD, the modified Julian day number MJD is
    defined as MJD = JD - 2,400,000.5. This has two purposes:

       1. Days begin at midnight rather than noon.
       2. For dates in the period from 1859 to about 2130 only five
          digits need to be used to specify the date rather than seven. 

    MJD 0 thus corresponds to JD 2,400,000.5, which is twelve hours
    after noon GMT on JD 2,400,000 = 1858-11-16 (Gregorian or Common
    Era). Thus MJD 0 designates the midnight of November 16th/17th,
    1858, so day 0 in the system of modified Julian day numbers is the
    day 1858-11-17 CE.

    The main virtue of the MJD is that such dates require fewer bytes of
    memory for storage (8) <#refs>. For calendrical studies the
    chronological Julian day number is preferable.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

          7. Lilian Day Number

    This concept is similar to that of the Julian day number. It is
    named after Aloysius Lilius
    <http://www.knight.org/advent/cathen/09247c.htm> (an advisor to Pope
    Gregory XIII) who was one of the principal inventors of the
    Gregorian Calendar reform. The Lilian day number is defined as "the
    number of days since 14 October 1582 in the proleptic Gregorian
    Calendar <cal_art.html#Proleptic>". This was the time of the
    introduction of the Gregorian Calendar
    <cal_art.html#Gregorian_Reform>, when it was decreed by Pope Gregory
    XIII that the day following 4 October 1582 (which is 5 October 1582,
    in the Julian Calendar) would thenceforth be known as 15 October
    1582. Strictly speaking there is no "14 October 1582" in the
    Gregorian Calendar, since the Gregorian Calendar did not begin until
    15 October 1582, thus the need (in the definition to refer to the
    "proleptic" Gregorian Calendar). Thus 15 October 1582 GC is Lilian
    day 1 (the first day of the Gregorian Calendar), 16 October 1582 is
    Lilian day 2, and so on.

    It is not known whether Lilius himself employed this concept. Joe
    Kress has traced the earliest use of the Lilian day number to its
    inventor, Bruce G. Ohms of IBM in 1986 (7) <#refs>.

    The relation between Julian day numbers and Lilian day numbers is:
    LDN = JDN - 2,299,160

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

          8. Different Meanings of "Julian Date"

    The term "Julian date" has three different meanings, two of them
    entirely respectable and the third used only by those who don't know
    any better.

    (i) As noted above, a Julian date is a date in the Julian Calendar
    <cal_art.html>, the predecessor of the Gregorian Calendar.

    (ii) Astronomers and calendricists use the term in this sense, but
    (as explained in Section 4 <#astronomical> and Section 5
    <#chronological> above) also in another sense, according to which a
    Julian date is a number, denoting a point in time, which consists of
    an integer part and a fractional part (e.g., 2439291.301), where the
    integer part is a Julian day number <#julian_day_number> and the
    fractional part specifies the time elapsed since the start of the
    day denoted by that Julian day number.

    (iii) In the commercial world the term "Julian date" has
    unfortunately been used for a quite different concept, that of the
    number of the day in a particular year, so that January 1st = day 1,
    February 28th = day 59, and so on. To use the term "Julian date" to
    mean day-of-year when the term also means a date in the Julian
    Calendar (not to mention its use in the third sense by astronomers
    and calendricists) is simply to invite confusion. Those who study
    calendars unanimously recommend that the use of the term "Julian
    date" to mean "number of the day in the year" be dropped. It has
    been suggested in the Wikipedia article on ISO 8601
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601> that the term ordinal date
    be used, and this seems sensible.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

          9. Conversion Algorithms

    Mathematicians and programmers have naturally interested themselves
    in mathematical and computational algorithms to convert between
    Julian day numbers and Gregorian dates. The following conversion
    algorithm is due to Henry F. Fliegel and Thomas C. Van Flandern:

    The Julian day (jd) is computed from Gregorian day, month and year
    (d, m, y) as follows:

     jd = ( 1461 * ( y + 4800 + ( m - 14 ) / 12 ) ) / 4 +
          ( 367 * ( m - 2 - 12 * ( ( m - 14 ) / 12 ) ) ) / 12 -
          ( 3 * ( ( y + 4900 + ( m - 14 ) / 12 ) / 100 ) ) / 4 +
          d - 32075

    Converting from the Julian day number to the Gregorian date is
    performed thus:

        l = jd + 68569
        n = ( 4 * l ) / 146097
        l = l - ( 146097 * n + 3 ) / 4
        i = ( 4000 * ( l + 1 ) ) / 1461001
        l = l - ( 1461 * i ) / 4 + 31
        j = ( 80 * l ) / 2447
        d = l - ( 2447 * j ) / 80
        l = j / 11
        m = j + 2 - ( 12 * l )
        y = 100 * ( n - 49 ) + i + l

    Days are integer values in the range 1-31, months are integers in
    the range 1-12, and years are positive or negative integers.
    Division is to be understood as in integer arithmetic, with
    remainders discarded.

    In these algorithms Julian day number 0 corresponds to
    -4713-11-24 GC, which is -4712-01-01 JC.

    These algorithms are valid only in the Gregorian Calendar and the
    proleptic Gregorian Calendar <cal_art.html#Proleptic>. They do not
    correctly convert dates in the Julian Calendar.

    It seems that the designers of these algorithms intended them to be
    used only with non-negative Julian day numbers (corresponding to
    Gregorian dates on and after -4713-11-24 G). In fact they are valid
    (only) for dates from -4900-03-01 G onward when converting from a
    Julian day number to a date, and (only) from -4800-03-01 G onward
    when converting from a date to a Julian day number.
