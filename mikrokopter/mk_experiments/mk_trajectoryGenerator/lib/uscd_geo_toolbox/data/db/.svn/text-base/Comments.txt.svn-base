DataBase Toolbox

The DataBase Toolbox provides an easier access to DataFiles
in the RODB-Format, which are DataFiles with Header.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Syntax for a Datafile:

ROOT/BASE/NAME/TYPE/NAME_???.###

- ROOT is the Main-Directory of the DataBase,
- BASE is a Name of a Experiment or Region,
- NAME is a Name of a Mooring or Cruise,
- TYPE is a Name of an Instrument or DataType

The Name of each Datafile should start with NAME,
the DataFiles of an TYPE should be numbered ("???").
The Extension of a DatafileName should be equal to TYPE.

The Datafiles has a Header with informations about
the dataset in the Structure:
 
   Variable1 = Value1
   Variable2 = Value2

The last HeaderVariable should define the DataColumns,
with the Variable "Columns", the VariableNames in the Value
are separated by the ColonCharacter ":", example:

   Columns = P:T:S

VariableNames for Header and Data are defined in DBINIT.
Other Variables are allowed.

The Data follows the Header in individiualy Columns.

-----------------------------------------------------------
InfoFile:

Each Cruise or Mooring should have an InfoFile like:

ROOT/BASE/NAME/NAMEinfo.dat

The HeaderVariables of the InfoFile should specify
the Project, Location, Date and Time, etc. 

The DataColumns for Moorings should be
the InstrumentTypes, SerialNumbers and Depth, 
for Cruises the Stations with Position and Date and Time.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Inquire Data:

DataBase-Directory (ROOT) should be set by DBROOT.
Inquire or modify other settings by DBSET.

Use DBFILE to check which Datafiles exist in the DataBase-Directory,
and DBLOAD to load Data.
