Access NetCDF-DataFiles

Use LOOK_CDF for a quick look into a NetCDF-DataFile.

Use ASSIGN_CDF or READ_CDF to load NetCDF-Data directly.

Similar functions exist to read HDF-SD-DataFiles.

Use LOAD_CDF to load gridded NetCDF-Data. To use
LOAD_CDF a ConfigFile has to exist, which describes 
max. 4 Dimensions (X, Y, Z and Time) and DataVariables
for a NetCDF-DataFile. Use CNF_CDF to create a ConfigFile.

Write NetCDF-DataFiles with WRITE_CDF or WRT_CDF.

Take care that a valid platform-depended 
MEX-file-interface like MEXCDF or MEXNC exist
to access NetCDF-DataFiles. 

MEX-file-interfaces should located in "mexcdf/".
